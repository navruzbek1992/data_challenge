### [News and stock return relationship (Tutorial)](/projects/news_and_boeing_stocks.html)

What are the main drivers of stock price movement? This is one of the main questions of investors and researchers. Fundamental analysis tells us to focus on the market index in order to investigate the stock since the efficient market hypothesis assumes that prices already incorporated every accessible public news and information. Fortunately, in this data abundant period we can actually gather and analyze news articles quite easily and efficiently. 

This tutorial is about exploring the imminent effect of news on stock price movement. First, I scraped through web to gather news information about specific stock. I focused only on Nasdaq.com news section to save time, however, the same analysis could be extended in a larger scale to cover other news sources.

Following the scraping through the web, text is cleaned thoroughly and analyzed through sentiment analysis (VADER) to investigate if the text contains negative or positive sentiment about the stock. Lastly, I used newly constructed variable to explain stock returns together with market return (empirical CAPM). (Answer codes are given in Python).
